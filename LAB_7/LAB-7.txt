Hereâ€™s a structured AIM (Aim, Importance, and Methodology) summary of your ARP and static routing configuration on Cisco switches, along with the components, network design, step-by-step configuration process, and expected outcomes.

### AIM
**Aim:**  
To configure ARP and static routing between two Cisco switches to facilitate communication between two VLANs (VLAN 10 and VLAN 20) and ensure correct ARP entries are established for devices in each VLAN.

### Importance
**Importance:**  
This configuration is essential for enabling inter-VLAN communication in a network environment where devices are segregated into different VLANs. Proper ARP configuration ensures devices can resolve IP addresses to MAC addresses, allowing seamless communication. This setup is vital for maintaining a well-functioning network infrastructure, supporting efficient data transfer between VLANs.

### Components
1. **Hardware:**
   - Two Cisco 3560 switches.
   - PCs for each VLAN:
     - VLAN 10: PC A1 (192.168.10.2), PC A2 (192.168.10.3)
     - VLAN 20: PC B1 (192.168.20.2), PC B2 (192.168.20.3)

2. **Network Topology:**
   - **Switch 1 (VLAN 10)**:
     - VLAN IP: 192.168.10.1
   - **Switch 2 (VLAN 20)**:
     - VLAN IP: 192.168.20.1
   - **Trunk Link** between Switch 1 and Switch 2.

### Step-by-Step Configuration Process

#### Step 1: Configure VLANs and Assign IP Addresses

**On Switch 1:**
```plaintext
enable
configure terminal
vlan 10
 name Network_A
exit

interface range fastethernet 0/1 - 2
 switchport mode access
 switchport access vlan 10
 no shutdown
exit

interface vlan 10
 ip address 192.168.10.1 255.255.255.0
 no shutdown
exit

interface fastethernet 0/24
 switchport mode trunk
 switchport trunk allowed vlan 10,20
 no shutdown
exit
```

**On Switch 2:**
```plaintext
enable
configure terminal
vlan 20
 name Network_B
exit

interface range fastethernet 0/1 - 2
 switchport mode access
 switchport access vlan 20
 no shutdown
exit

interface vlan 20
 ip address 192.168.20.1 255.255.255.0
 no shutdown
exit

interface fastethernet 0/24
 switchport mode trunk
 switchport trunk allowed vlan 10,20
 no shutdown
exit
```

#### Step 2: Enable IP Routing
**On both Switches:**
```plaintext
ip routing
```

#### Step 3: Configure Static Routing (if necessary)
Static routes can be configured for external networks, if required:
```plaintext
ip route [destination_network] [subnet_mask] [next_hop_address]
```

#### Step 4: Configure ARP
Add ARP entries if necessary:
```plaintext
arp 192.168.20.2 00:11:22:33:44:55   // On Switch 1
arp 192.168.10.2 00:66:77:88:99:AA   // On Switch 2
```

#### Step 5: Configure IP Addresses on the PCs
Assign IP addresses and gateways as follows:
- **PC A1:** 192.168.10.2, Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0, Default Gateway: 192.168.10.1
- **PC A2:** 192.168.10.3, Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0, Default Gateway: 192.168.10.1
- **PC B1:** 192.168.20.2, Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0, Default Gateway: 192.168.20.1
- **PC B2:** 192.168.20.3, Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0, Default Gateway: 192.168.20.1

#### Step 6: Verify Configuration and Connectivity
1. **Ping from PC A1 to PC B1:**
   ```plaintext
   ping 192.168.20.2
   ```
2. **Check ARP Table on Switches:**
   ```plaintext
   show ip arp
   ```
3. **Check Routing Table on Switches:**
   ```plaintext
   show ip route
   ```

### Outcome
By following this configuration process, communication between devices in VLAN 10 (PC A1 and PC A2) and VLAN 20 (PC B1 and PC B2) should be successfully established. The ability to ping across VLANs indicates proper routing and ARP functionality. ARP tables on the switches will reflect the mappings of IP addresses to MAC addresses, confirming that devices can resolve network addresses correctly.
